Long story short, wrote the portfolio code from scratch. Had to make sure all code was running properly. 

Although, after many attempts, I could not figure out how to wrap the bottom cards under the first one. I have set up an office hours appointment for Thursday as it was the earliest. 

I also have to brush up the lines and the foundation of the code but -- I have followed the acceptance criteria as much as I possibly could. 

I learned a lot, but naturally, I still have to brush up more on some specific concepts. The positive takeaway from this is I know what my weaknesses are. 

My next portfolio, will be even better. I take this not as a failure, but as a learning experience.
