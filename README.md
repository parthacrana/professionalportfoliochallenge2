Feel free to explore any or all of these files! 

Long story short, wrote the portfolio code from scratch. Had to make sure all code was running properly. 

Although, after many attempts, I could not figure out how to wrap the bottom cards under the first one. I have set up an office hours appointment for Thursday as it was the earliest. 

I have also started commiting and pushing changes via gitbash (windows) more often! 

I also have to brush up the lines and the foundation of the code but -- I have followed the acceptance criteria as much as I possibly could. 

I learned a lot, but naturally, I still have to brush up more on some specific concepts. The positive takeaway from this is I know what my weaknesses are. 

My next portfolio, will be even better. I take this not as a failure, but as a learning experience.
